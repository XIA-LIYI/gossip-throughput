1. circular buffer or set?
2. calculate memory


1. queueing effect happends when system runs at full capacity
2. identify the inheritent tradeoff of throughput and latency
3. realistic injection method
4. avoid infinite queue and still realistic 
5. cannot expect global information
6. explore different methods: 
    a. depend on queue length, does not seem to work well because it is not always the case
    what we care is number of real items that cause latency. but average queue length does not tell us
    b. relate to dummy message
